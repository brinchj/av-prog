\chapter*{Introduction}

In this project we we had there tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Task 1: Implementation of universal machine specification
\item Task 2: Parse
\item Task 3: 2D code generator 
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Choice of language}
We started out trying to parse and implement a subsection of the Ocult language. In order to understand the Ocult language we began formalizing the semantics, which proved to be a fruit-full labour, as it resulted in a twelf formalization, which can be found in \ref{appendix:twelf}. However, due to problems in parsing the Ocult language, as well as lack of time, we decided to instead implement the Simple Expression Language proposed at the website, with a few additions - such as function calls and variables, in order to make it interesting.
