\label{sec:compiling-sel-2d}

In this section, we present the methodology behind compiling from SEL
into 2d. The basic idea is that we define a representation of natural
numbers in 2d and then we use boxes of 2d to represent SEL programs in
2d. We begin by noting that most of our operations are straightforward
to compile into 2d code. The hard part is how to handle the boxes.

Recall that a box contains wires in each direction, NESW. To
interconnect two boxes, we just have to set the wire of one box to the
wire of the other. We prune unneeded wires in the layout code later
on.

We compile each SEL function seperately into its own module. When
compiling a SEL expression, we do it inside a state monad. The state
in the monad tracks what the next free wire-number is, the currently
operating environment, what wires have left the module and a list of
input wires. The monad allows us to quickly create new wires and
eliminates the need for passing around a large amount of boring
information. We note that some of this information is deemed static
and as such the state monad could have been wrapped in a reader
transformer. But it was seen as too complicated for a problem this
simple.

A set of helper functions allows us to join boxes together in groups
in various ways. When we join the boxes into groups, we identify a
public interface to the group in each direction. The public interface
simplifies later join operations.


\paragraph{Compiling Expressions}
\label{sec:compiling-numbers}

Natural numbers are compiled like it was laid out in the hints PDF to
task 3. Zero is represented as one injection in the sum-type, and Succ
x is represented as the other. Expressions that use arithmetic makes
use of the standard library and simply calls the appropriate module.

Looking up in the environment compiles the tree in the environment and
sends its result to the place in the AST where it is needed. Finally,
a function call compiles its single input and then uses the
appropriate module.

\paragraph{Compiling functions}
\label{sec:compiling-functions}

Compiling a function has the complication that there is only a single
wire of input, but the input might be used multiple times in the
function body. We solve this problem by first counting the number of
occurrences in the body. We note that for the few cases we have there
is no problem in handling this. For a greater number of cases, one could
have utilized the generics of Haskell here.

We then construct a series of boxes, duplicating the input by
splitting tuples. The wires with the input is gathered and when
compiling expressions we keep these input wires in a list in the state
of the monad.
