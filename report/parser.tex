\section{Parser}
In order to translate the code into 2d, we must first parse the Ocult code and turn it into an abstract syntax tree. This will be done in an independant module in order to maximize the modularity of the code.

\subsection{Use of Parsec}
Due to its age and stability we have choosen to use the Parsec Haskell module to write our Paser. Even though it might be possible to create something better through the user of Monad transformers and [Blah] [atribute], but doing so would take a longer time, as well as introducing common parser errors that has already been found and eliminated in Parsec.
