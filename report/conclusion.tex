\chapter*{Conclusion}

As it has been made clear by our report, we have not been able to get
a entirely working system up and running. However, we have clearly
made headway, and it is likewise clear that with more time we would
have been able to implement the SEL. Our primary difilculty has not
surprising been the implementation of the layout system and the
compiler, whose implementation we defered too long.

\paragraph{Lessons for the future}
In the future it would seem to be best to start with a very small
language, and then work upwards from that.
