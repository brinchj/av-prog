# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.

Task 2b: We are considering staging this. Use some time on building a simpler variant of O'cult (with sane advise-semantics) and get that compiler working. Then stage it up to include 2d.
