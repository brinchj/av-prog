# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
     New TODO:

     * Write the compiler. Easy I hope.
     ** To write the compiler, start by looking at the language source.
     ** Then begin adding the missing parts systematically. Write them down here first,
        before attempting to write the compilation steps for them.
