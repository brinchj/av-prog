# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
     New TODO:

     * Figure out the representation of modules w.r.t. the explicitorder.
       DRAW THIS ON PAPER.

     * Build a renderer for the module.

     * Correct the way we introduce a module from the perspective of compilation.

     * Compile a subset of our language.

     * TEST

     * Iteratively extend the compilation to more parts.
