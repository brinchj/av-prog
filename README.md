# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
  First, we need a way to compile Ocult, or a variant hereof down to the internal 2d representation.
  Next, we need a way to output 2d representations to provide a 2d program.
