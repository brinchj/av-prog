# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
     New TODO:

     * Wrap the compiler inside a monad for wires.
     * Change the representation of boxes to contain wires
       (first order)
     * Change the joining representation to take care of implicit
       wiring.

     * Build some basic code for wiring together blocks

     * Raise the blocks to an applicative functor.
