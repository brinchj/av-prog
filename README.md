# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
     New TODO:

     * In topological order, we should lay out the blocks with implicit
       representation.

     * For each subblock, output the things we need to output.
     * join together the type errors
