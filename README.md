# Course project on advanced programming

This is the course project on advanced programming.

## Status

Task 1: Mostly done, we don't need much here.

Task 2a: Mikkel has looked at Parsec.
  I have added some new attempt at writing a parser.
  It still needs some testing.

Task 2b: We need 2 things here:
     New TODO:

     * Use the generated liveness information to build up the EOM
       start end end code. When this is done, it should be easier
       to render the contents of boxes.
